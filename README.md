# exceptions-and-extensions
###### 'do not mention exceptions please!'; things are not allowed to be discussed or mentioned because of mixed quantum-binary-ternary nature of my brain and soul
#### this is an exception i may not use in my sticky notes
- i have following note in my 'google keep'
> ```
> MURKY NOTES!
>     THEY DESTROY THE CODE!!!
>     to write down IMMEDIATELY!
> ```
- and while i ...`[kernel panic]` ...in twenty minutes i needed to
create this description i have lost actual `exception`!
if i would recollect i would write it here. a keypoint was that i
may not fix it in my pinned note.
- multitasking you now ...singing choosing words and writing has
erased the example from my memory
- it works by an association i guess —like you know[^1] `'do not repeat
learned material before the exam'` rule (i always forgot verses if
breaking this rule while studied in high school)
#### ~ok~ After recovering from memory failure and subsequent shock
here is `example 1 v.2`
- i can read
- i can recognize images
- but i am `3d‐blind`
- so if use something like android with task list of Kit Kat style or
alike `i cannot choose application ESPECIALLY after stupidly introduced
reordering` because of my failure with ~letters and all other shapes~
- and so i use `colors only` in physical reality for spatial orientation
- and IT DOES WORK for me in virtual reality! (apps, interfaces etc)
- what does happen if a snapshot is blank or black after OS was not
in time with making task list?
`i fail FOR SURE!`
- what does happen if there are several identical white/black/etc
backgrounds with some indistinctive patterns on them (letters/dwarves/organs/etc)?
`i fail FOR SURE!`
##### example 1 v.2
`being a programmer i may not request for following interface or even
consider implementing it —but I WOULD NOT FAIL WITH IT EVER —plain
placeholders COLORED DISTINCTIVELY for representing apps in a task list`
[^1]: telling 'association' here i mean PRECISELY THIS phenomenon so i do not agree with dominant view that it is caused by a habituation: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habituation —because my brain&soul DO report TOTALLY different data on the matter; 'Habituation is a form of non-associative learning in which an innate (non-reinforced) response to a stimulus decreases after repeated or prolonged presentations of that stimulus [...] Habituation is clinically relevant, as a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism, schizophrenia, migraine, and Tourette's, show reductions in habituation to a variety of stimulus-types both simple (tone) and complex (faces) [...] In human clinical studies, habituation is most often studied using the acoustic startle reflex; acoustic tones are delivered to participants through headphones and the subsequent eye-blink response is recorded directly by observation or by electromyography (EMG). Depending on the disorder, habituation phenomena have been implicated as a cause, symptom, or therapy. Reduced habituation is the most common habituation phenotype reported across neuropsychiatric disorders although enhanced habituation has been observed in HD and ADHD. It also appears that abnormal habituation is often predictive of symptom severity in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including ASD, PD, and HD. Moreover, there are instances where treatments that normalise the habituation-deficit also improve other associated symptoms...'
