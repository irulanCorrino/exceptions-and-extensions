# exceptions-and-extensions
###### 'do not mention exceptions please!'; things are not allowed to be discussed or mentioned because of mixed quantum-binary-ternary nature of my brain and soul
#### this is an exception i may not use in my sticky notes
- i have following note in my 'google keep'
> ```
> MURKY NOTES!
>     THEY DESTROY THE CODE!!!
>     to write down IMMEDIATELY!
> ```
- and while i ...`[kernel panic]` ...in twenty minutes i needed to
create this description i have lost actual `exception`!
if i would recollect i would write it here. a keypoint was that i
may not fix it in my pinned note.
- multitasking you now ...singing choosing words and writing has
erased the example from my memory
- it works by an association i guess â€”like you know `'do not repeat
learned material before the exam'` rule (i always forgot verses if
breaking this rule while studied in high school)
