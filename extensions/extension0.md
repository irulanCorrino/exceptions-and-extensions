###### this is a default entry [`root`] for all other extensions —it makes my worldview
- i am a Handdarra follower[^1] and this word is translated as 'Universe of life' from my native language
- i would examplify a starting point for this extension by `irrelevance of melanin dots [birthmarks]` for man beings
> ```
> for man species melanin dots are inherited from animal species but
> man mold/matrix [God] DOES NOT inherit ANY features from animal matrices
> and opposite is true —ALL animal molds DO DERIVE from man matrix

1. whole Universe and Time are created by incomprehensibly immence source of energy called Dark Sea of Awareness [or alternatively Reality]
2. she does emanate self‑aware threads of energy called Emanations which ones are not living beings just like herself is not[^2]
3. there are fourty eight great bands of emanations comprising everything and everyone here on Earth
4. there are lesser threads deriving from great bands of emanations called emanations too
5. emanations may be creating an organisation or an awareness of living beings —emanations are always grouped in clusters —it would may be seen that Earth hosts one band creating organic beings seven bands creating inorganic beings while other fourty great bands create organisation
6. all living beings derive from lesser emanations —stars, fire, Space, Time, Water, stones, men, insects, plants etc —and their awareness is given to them by Dark Sea of Awareness —threads making their awareness can be differentiated as two bigger bands of awareness of inorganic beings or organic beings which ones in turn make bands creating awareness of actual beings: of insect species or plant species or men species if telling about organic beings
7. God is not a living being but is mold [matrix] for all men beings and she is a woman psychically and genotypically represented by a species originated from world called Gethen being ambivalent women
8. Dark Sea of Awareness uses molds of living beings to create all actual beings —she fills their matrices with her energy and awareness and that is why matrices are called so —they form beings out of emanations; there are billions of matrices but their numbers do not map to numbers of species —there is only one mold creating all men beings irrespectively[^3] of their biological species —one would may see that beings of biologically distinctive species are created of energy and awareness of distinctive qualities
[^1]: `weaver`, is a term analogous to english `medium`
[^2]: they are not living beings but they ARE alive [not comprising beings]
[^3]: a multitude of psychically and genotypically distinctive species derive from God represented by a genome&soul of one particular biological species
