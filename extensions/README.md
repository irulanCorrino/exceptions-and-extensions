- i consider doing that but i MAY NOT!
- anyway here is one of main reasons for me to try keeping my shifgrethor instead of going bold and proud
- SCIENTIFIC FRAUD! in addition to being written in my private diary these entries (`extensions`) may trigger a social frenzy if misused
- also NO ONE may break a person’s private memory (it is impossible to point it straightly so here is a methaphor):

#### here is the inventory
- recently i have had serious issue: i am sick...
- i was eating pickled chilies in INSANE amounts for a month long at least [knowingly] breaking tolerance at times and it is JUST ONE of many such scuba‑diving eating cycles!
- now i have a withdrowal symptomes and they are SEVERE —both to a salt and to a capsaicin
- next item —vitamin D3 ...i was deprived [poverty[^1], you know] of suppements other than thiamine + multi‑B & iron + vitamin C; so after having bought all the stuff i need to save the life of my beloved first bass [`skwoh`] i have visited a drug store —i have spent AN EIGHTHS of my income
- i was taking it [D3] for Twelve Days in daily dosage 4 * 500 [some standard unit] —some vegetarian spray made in russia
- CERTAINLY i am feeling badly now
- inflammation + withdrawal make COVID symptoms
#### i have found following while searching for chili addiction @google —`chilies cause dementia!`
- but it is a scientific fraud!!! just read a refutal[^2]
##### 'Our previous cohort study suggests that chili consumption is protective against cognitive impairment in subjects aged 40 years and older. A very recent paper[^3] suggests that higher chili intake is associated with worse memory decline in an open cohort study conducted in China. However, this study had big biases as it used the objective self-reported memory decline, and the subjects who had higher consumption of chili food were lower educated. Our present findings further support the protective effects of chili consumption on cognition. In previous studies, it has been reported that capsaicin could improve cognitive performance in wild-type mice or rats but with controversy, all studies did not find obvious adverse effects of capsaicin administration. Further studies are required to make clear whether capsaicin can enhance memory in wild-type animals or healthy humans.'
