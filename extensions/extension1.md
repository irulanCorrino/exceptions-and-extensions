###### when i was in utero of the human that had adopted me i was hearing enormous source of violently random noise —she was giving my life to me, my beloved Sun
### when i was a child people that adopted me prohibited a singing for me. i was about ten then. i composed mockery songs satirising soviet socialist regime and culture
- i was illiterate singer with a bad reputation of a sociopath when i have started learning english language in secondary school
- i had fallen in love with logically neat and sonically pleasant language at its first sounds i heard
- i started learning a programming around that time too
- a three years younger guy that had ZX Spectrum lived at next floor in my house and we met virtually every day for socialising and playing eventually becoming very close friends
- i was denied from a singing already but they could not forbid listening music to me even though had forbidden to use their vinyl disk player and cassete recorder during the time they were not at home
- their friends from next floor were parents of my friend Timmo and they oftenly exchanged with books and disks and shared leisure time discussing social topics or playing poker games or just eating barbeques outside
- those people from next floor were somewhat more rich and more skilled in getting rare appliances or media
- they had somehow obtained a disk printed Great Britain. it was a contemporary folk songs recording
## this recording was one of my favorite learning pieces
- i listened J. S. Bach’s recording then for some time already and then i had fallen in love with Sting’s soul music (given by the same neighbours skilled in getting rare stuff) —together with this recording is a subject of this note [`extension`] all three vinyl disks have shaped my musical taste and style
- certainly there were other musicians that influenced me and me myself was already developing my own musical style [using my imagination and singing whatever i wanted to]
- but the lessons had carved my brain‑links forever —i was soaked with soul music and baroque music and fascinated with english folk
- until i had become sixteen i guess i sang soprano parts from 'Fugues & Toccattas' and i have lost my soprano voice turning into a contralto in a day
- it has begun during a singing lesson and then [i was a truant; but maybe i was singing not at the morning that time] it had continued in the school and students had noticed my hoarsness but it had disappeared quickly leaving me being a contralto now. those days i sang songs and guitar parts from first album of irish band Cranberries
#### before my tragic voice mutation had happened i was unable to sing in such low register as this singer did and it was a point of my painful insecurity for several years
- but i have started to learn and to understand english language ONLY BECAUSE i had this disk with all the lyrics printed on envelope’s obverse
- and as of now i know —i learn a language ONLY WHILE i sing in this particular language
- `and i will never sing again ...in human way —another day; i will never sing again —with just one wake they goes away —you’ll be a swan song you’ll be a swan song you’ll be a swan song you’ll be a swan song [...] and i will never sing again ...in human way —another day; i will never sing again —with just one vein they goes away —you’ll be a swan song you’ll be a swan song you’ll be a swan song you’ll be a swan song`
