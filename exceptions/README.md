- who would confirm this? 'Chumpih EXTENDED CONFIRMED USERS 2,097 EDITS' —but he or she is deriding on matter of usability of C for 'applications or preferably utilities' in our time of evolved programming languages ...so maybe he or she would be much more influential and tolerant 'Fbergo EXTENDED CONFIRMED USERS 3,423 EDITS'? those articles are toys for wikipedians who try to keep up with their policies and protect their belongings from vandalisms

>    —when i was seventeen i had passed the exams to an institute where i studied
>  programming: once in a week (i guess) a professor from commercial university gave
>  a lesson, a progress was as follows —1st lesson (colored&shaped objects sorting
>  problem) = no one had understood it; 2nd lesson (some similarly contrieved problem)
>  = i had had '3' mark [out of five degrees]; 3rd lesson (...) = i had had '5' mark;
>  ['5'...'5']; 10th lesson or even later = i had had '5' mark AND a guy used to
>  386&486 PC
>    [from a rich family, a gamer, top‑rank school in the city, self‑reported experience
>  with C, like a couple of other guys who were from his neighbourhood and same school
>  —when on first lesson i had reported my experience with BASIC they all and many other
>  students laughed]
>    and a guy had had '3' mark (or maybe '4'); another student had had positive results
>  on twentieth lesson i guess [a guy from my village who was used to math, different
>  computer architecture in his school, a participant in many contests, his mother was
>  a school teacher in math];
>    at winter (after exams) i stopped visiting social sciences and visited only
>  programming & maybe english
>       (maybe i was permitted go home from english at times then)
>    when spring had begun (some lessons were canceled because professor had
>  poor health);
>    when i had bought my copy of 'Borland Turbo Pascal 5.0' primer
>  [obligatory for a student] and when the practise on real 486 PC had begun i had left
>  the institute.
>
>    my main reason was not even stupid Pascal nor unwieldy Windows 95 OS nor
>  professor’s lack of interest in real world programming on tangible 486 PC machines
>  —i disliked flow charts even not thinking damn a word about my hatred to them —in a
>  school i wrote in BASIC Vylnius (for PDP11 clones) —i never draw any chart —only
>  coded with pen & paper @home and a computer @school
>    [[as i have found a couple of days ago] my most evolved app’s GUI design resembled
>  MacDraw (by Apple for Macintosh that i have not even ever seen, only if being
>  minimimalist to ground point, i had many unimplemented ideas however (all mine);
>  i had started it in the same age when started learning BASIC —it was keyboard driven
>  and all features were invented solely by me —it was diffucult to make appealing images
>  like those ones from Corel Draw 5 promos or whatsoever on ancient halting clones),
>  my school teacher tried to introduce it into school’s courses on IT by inviting every
>  group even those of fifth grade for drawing pictures in his free time;
>  he oftenly complained on BASIC’s obligatory status then recommending Logo to me but
>  when [...he was quiet retarded to be a programmer] ...when he had found a copy of Logo

>  even if coming from their corresponding workstation counterparts even from very same
>  architecture from another place —and their FDD was very jerky and unreliable (@server,

>  lesson to me nor had changed my code —he opened the door unlocked secure 'mesh‑door'
>  unlocked power box switched power on the transformer booted BASIC system over
>  the network and then he oftenly left for several hours to physics classroom to take
>  several drinks of something while me was all alone in IT classroom coding and hacking
>  my software
