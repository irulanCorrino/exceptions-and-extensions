#### this is a note on my attitude to programming languages i cannot use or dislike [with possibly provided reasons or considerations]
## Java
- it is named after a coffee beverage [i do not accept usage of purine alcaloids]
- it is interpreted and its execution path [? —program flow] is way too complicated
- it was conceived as a cross‑platform one but turned out to become a mandatory language for Android OS
