is it a hypocrisy? open a wikipedia's [Masturbation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation) article --do you think THIS IS a gross indecency to publish such an ARTICLE?  
the image i have posted in my censored post was NOT A PROVOCATIVE one! Nicki Minaj posts her nudes herself! do you think she`s guilty of indecent exposure?  
you CAN TRY REMOVING re-posted photo [i mentioned it in my OP at that printing issue thread so it's NOT IRRELEVANT] but...

Dude, <del>Gal</del> (my initial guess was correct, dude it is) this is a computer-related board and while we sometimes allow and even encourage political discourse, we can't let it slide completely into irrelevancy.  

People posting here are expected to meet and exhibit a minimum degree of reasoning as to what is relevant to Artix and what is either virtue signalling or parroting propaganda. Being "progressive" or "conservative" is a right everyone is entitled to and not a reason to be mocked or derided for. Our developers are from all around the world, our users come from all sides of the political spectrum and Artix itself is political in nature, in the sense it's a "dissident" distribution against a corporate EEE movement. But that's where it ends. Each team member has his own opinions and beliefs but Artix as a project will not adopt a current thing, trend or narrative.  

Last but not least, the people who run the forum have a long record of devotion and sound reasoning; they work in their spare time and have been with us since the beginning. They know their stuff and we should accept their judgement, which so far has been fair and rare.  

TL;DR: we will not tolerate motions trying to paint Artix in hues and colors not befitting its primary nature, a systemd-free Linux distribution geared towards experienced users.

i am not "Dude".  
if you can call a woman with word "Male" that is your personal problem.  

postulating a software AND political freedom you nevertheless emulate China Communist Party or United Russia.  
go ban me for objecting your freedom serving only your political tastes and needs!  
you would not be first doing that

Hey i am telling "YOU HAVE CENSORED ME" at a board titled "Forum" --issues related to posting are expected to go here --female beauty is not a "current thing, trend or narrative" --i am raising an issue of FREEDOM OF SPEECH and not mocking devs or moderators.  
i am a programmer AND a woman so if you are misogynists[^1] ruling for your own closed craft here --i leave!!!

Posting nudity isn't appropriate or relevant to any section of our forum, even the Off-Topic; you have conflated the concept of free speech with unsolicited spam.

Dude has become unisex.  
From wikipedia  
> <ins>Quote</ins>  
> In the early 1960s, dude became prominent in surfer culture as a synonym of guy or fella. The female equivalent was "dudette" or "dudess", but these have both fallen into disuse and "dude" is now also used as a unisex term.

I use it that way in the UK and so do many other people. Maybe it depends on the country ?  
So the original was accurate.  

And speaking for myself only I don't want to see any male, female or non-binary nudity on the forum. (I sort of thought that was just a given).

OP posted the first image to shock imho. Whines when it gets removed. This is why I'd be a rubbish mod because at the point of reposting the removed image I'd have banned them.  
Random three words of the day.

What do you even know about censorship and Soviet Union? You never know what it is like. I was born and raised in Russia and have been living under Putin’s dictatorship 22 out of my 30 years old. Many Russians who do not support Putin's dictatorship are being oppressed and arrested. No matter whether you are expressing your opinion on war in Ukraine or just calling it invasion and war (Russian propaganda treats it as a ‘special military operation’) you are going to be arrested. Rallies and single-person pickets are also prohibited in Russia, people are seized and taken to custody. The authorities have been issuing repressive laws round o’clock. I don’t know what I should do to stop it. If I came out to rally against the war I would get charged with discrediting of Russian army and imprisoned for 10 years according to our legislation.  

Written above is the real censorship and human rights violations. So, you are trying to post information unrelated to this forum and wondering why you had your avatar edited? it's totally ludicrous.

There's no reason to go serious about this, it started being about a canon printer lol.  

And for some reason if to anyone that obscene pseudo-singer is called "example of female beauty", even by a troll as OP is we certainly live in the wrong times. I had my amusement reading this. Freedom is about more important subjects.

I'd like to think this was an elaborate troll, though who can really tell any more.  

If anyone was wondering (from wikipedia):  

- Shifgrethor is a fictional concept in the Hainish universe, first introduced in The Left Hand of Darkness.
- The Left Hand of Darkness is a science fiction novel by U.S. writer Ursula K. Le Guin.
- The Left Hand of Darkness was among the first books in the genre now known as feminist science fiction and is the most famous examination of androgyny in science fiction.
