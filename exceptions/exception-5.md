#### <div align="center">this essay is answering the question about my physical appearance</div>
## <div align="center">about being 'a Chapelle boy'</div>

i was long suspected for being a sexual pervert for my physical appearance. that is when i was seven or even six y.o. sexual predators stopped me on a street asking if me is a girl or a boy, and even people totally fine with their sexuality were confused by my behavior, manerisms and look.

i had begun growing tall at the age of thirteen i guess [at least my bones rememember it like that], but it was only in my fifteen when i had great acceleration of the growth. i had the voice mutation in the age of sixteen, during a lesson in public school, it had happened at sudden, and even though several hours before i was singing soprano parts from that famous album by Cranberries, now i was instantly turned into a contralto [i was singing REALLY loudly that day].

people said 'he has Marfan syndrome for sure --look how tall he is and so abnormally slender!..'  
not so long ago i was concerned with the issue and has done tests from Marfan society's page, here are the results:
- 'Reduced Upper Segment / Lower Segment & Increased Arm span / Height [would mean positive result]

  - Caucasion

    - Height (cm) 184
    - Arm span (cm): 193
    - Lower segment (cm): 99.5

- Upper/Lower segment ratio: 0.85
- Arm Span/Height Ratio: 1.05
 
- Upper/Lower Segment Ratio < 0.85 in whites, < 0.78 in blacks AND Increased Arm Span/Height > 1.05'

the result is NEGATIVE as you can see.  
and while i have joints flexibility atypical for a male and i can stretch far more than males, i fail those Marfan tests too, as well.  
in fact everything is against that assesment --no stretch marks or macular displacement or anything pointing to that connective tissue abnormality.  
i have no Marfan syndrome.

i have de la Chapelle syndrome instead.  
i have discovered this just a couple of months ago and was not sure until recently.  
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX_male_syndrome) does not tell about the appearance in a greater detail other than murky 'very feminine look', so i have found that at a site dedicated to differences between males and women.  
females have much lighter bones and the most important features for the facial recognition are that girls have rounder eye sockets and more pointed chin while males have those features square.  
and that is what i observe in a mirror for whole my life, and what causes such a great confusion to all the people around me.  
i am looking like a transmale athlete who underwent the hormone replacement therapy in her early teens ...just a bit less athletically ...actually not athletically at all.

having a height of 184cm i weight 70? 60? kg --i do not know because i live in a kinda rural town where we have no trade centers, gyms etc and i cannot afford a digital scale just for a one-shot measurement of my BMI. but when i was in the [mental facility] prison three years ago they tried to feed all the soup and refined starches into my poor head, and aside of getting ugly extra fat on a belly and worsened facial skin look i have gotten nothing --my bones had not increased their mass, even my undersized jaws.


#### <div align="center"><ins>this is a note from my private diary</ins></div>
### <div align="center">"god is man matrix"</div>

there was a recurrent dream that was coming to me even before i was born.  
i saw void space seemed to be deep cosmic space. there were not stars or galaxies; i was a woman woven from  
a big mesh net. i felt that my body was changing over the long long time i spent being in that empty space.  
in other my dreams about cosmic space there were galaxies and often i felt a presence of other men whom i met later.  
but in this dream i was alone.


### <div align="center"><ins>following three traits are beneficial[^1] in a world of darkness and slurry</ins></div>
- i have no pain. i do not know fear. i have more sensitive skin, hearing, color sensation etc.
  - 'A Scottish woman with a rare mutation in her FAAH gene that resulted in elevated anandamide levels was reported to be immune to anxiety, unable to experience fear, and insensitive to pain. The frequent burns and cuts she suffered due to her hypoalgesia healed more rapidly than was expected.'  
'[Anandamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide) (ANA), also known as N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), an N-acylethanolamine (NAE), is a fatty acid neurotransmitter. Anandamide was the first endocannabinoid to be discovered: it participates in the body's endocannabinoid system by binding to cannabinoid receptors, the same receptors that the psychoactive compound THC in cannabis acts on. [...]  
It is degraded primarily by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme, which converts anandamide into ethanolamine and arachidonic acid.'

- my blood is different from yours. i tolerate harsh chill conditions better.
  - '[Von Willebrand disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_disease) (VWD) is the most common hereditary blood-clotting disorder in humans. An acquired form can sometimes result from other medical conditions. It arises from a deficiency in the quality or quantity of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.'

- my vision is different from yours. i do not get distracted in low signal conditions.
  - i do not know depth relationships [orthogonally oriented axis of left and right eyes].
  - i rely on colors and use hearing sense to locate the things
    - [i do kinda advanced echolocation]
