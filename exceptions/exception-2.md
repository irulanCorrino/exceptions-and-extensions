## hello my Future!!! [**nonepitaxial, single-crystalline growth 2D materials**](https://news.mit.edu/2023/2d-atom-thin-industrial-silicon-wafers-0118)
- hand-helds with a computational power of best modern Intel desktop systems
- multi-effect DSPs with CPUs running Unix in guitars' control cavity
- radical genome modifications & protein design
- research on hibernation mode for interstellar travel

## fuck off my past!!! [**Scramjets, Capabilities, Et All**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M22_Zircon)
- > Please don't be lazy. There's no material that can do mach 10 in dense air incl diamond. Second, plasma stealth doesn't exist, plasma is a conductor hence reflects microwaves and also an emitter of radiation! Third yo can't use the initial weight to calculate the kinetic energy. Also the range makes no sense, you want us to believe it has more range than an F-16 while travelling at Mach 10? New fuel? What antimatter? All this is typical Russian wunderwaffen propaganda. They did the same in the past with the GR-1 missile etc. Zircon is just a slightly improved Granit missile. Maybe 10% faster, 10% more range. Russia has 10% the US GDP and a fraction of the R&D potential. Let's be realistic
- > Zircon does not achieve high enough speeds to achieve any significant cone of plasma. Please cease trying to meme it into reality, it won't happen. Also, haze yourself for reading National Interest and anything by Kyle Mizokami
- > Scramjets have, in official sources, never been confirmed. Further, at Mach 10, any maneuvering is... difficult. It turns out, that even missiles have G-Force limits. Further, scramjets are somewhat sensitive to such violent changes in airflow.
in therms of plasma stealth... What the heck. This sounds so much like technobabble gobbledygook it's insane. WE CAN DETECT, REENTERING CAPSULES. How the heck is a missile going to evade radar when every RAM on the planet degrades after a small bit of exposure to a pocket lighter, much less superheated gas?
...also, I uh, suspect this might have a problem with being really really easy to spot with thermals.
- > If the plasma cloud absorbs any radiation, how they want send any commands to the Zircon?
