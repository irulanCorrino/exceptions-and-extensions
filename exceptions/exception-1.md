#### this is a note on my attitude to programming languages i cannot use or dislike [with possibly provided reasons or considerations]
## Java
- it is named after a coffee beverage [i do not accept usage of purine alcaloids]
- it is interpreted and its execution path [? —program flow] is way too complicated
- it was conceived as a cross‑platform one but turned out to become a mandatory language for Android OS
## Wikipedia’s music critics’ shit
- they post it
- Wikipedia’s editors repost it
- the shit is approved by editors as a result of reposting by Wikipedia
- the shit is spread by the music critics recurrently
## C++
- it has bludgeoning feature creep
- it is conceived poorly
- it is designed poorly
- it is self‑unintelligible
## BASIC
- it is dumb
- it is verbose
- it is limiting to a speaker
- it is unusable for education
