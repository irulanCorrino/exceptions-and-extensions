#### this is a note on my attitude to programming languages i cannot use or dislike [with possibly provided reasons or considerations]
## Java
- it is named after a coffee beverage [i do not accept usage of purine alcaloids]
- it is interpreted and its execution path [? —program flow] is way too complicated
- it was conceived as a cross‑platform one but turned out to become a mandatory language for Android OS
## Wikipedia’s music critics’ shit
- they post it
- Wikipedia’s editors repost it
- the shit is approved by editors as a result of reposting by Wikipedia
- the shit is spread by the music critics recurrently
## C++
- it has bludgeoning feature creep
- it is conceived poorly
- it is designed poorly
- it is self‑unintelligible
## BASIC
- it is dumb
- it is verbose
- it is limiting to a speaker
- it is unusable for education
## Language Of Science, The
- Astrology
- Sexology
- Sociology [is it really necessary?]
- Psycopathology ...umm Psychology [is it approprite to do? see below]
- Theology [[!!!] reportedly, God has graciously allowed her clerical worshippers to study her]
- Demonology [i should have begun with this, but ...come on, it is too many sciences already!]
## Rust [neither 'cannot use' nor 'dislike']
- i like Rust. i really do
  - but here is the thing that puts me off:
    - HYPE
- if you want to learn as quickly as possible you would be better with C
- if you want readability AND maintainability you would be better if learning C
- if you DO NOT WANT to unadvertenly turn into AN OUTSIDER than you should learn C
- if you want A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE as primary means for your coding than you need to prefer C
- we all make mistakes. we really do. a programmer MAY NOT DO
