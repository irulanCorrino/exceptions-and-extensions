### <div align="center">a foreword</div>
- today there is much of misunderstanding among people about what is a future of transgender persons
  - there are bans of the subjet in some particularly hypocritical cultures and hate groups all around here
  - there are 'cis-look-alike' imposters provoking us on self-exposure before oppresive communities
  - there are social programs encouraging on undergoing [sex reassignment therapies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_therapy) or even [sex reassignment surgeries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery)
  - there are fashion influencers promoting 'The New Lifestyle' while pushing us to commit 'a coming out' embracing community's [pride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_pride)
- telling about myself i am not a gay[^1] and given to negatives like all Handdarra followers am not considering myself a transgender person
  - but the widely accepted opinion does insist me using such kind of comprehensible labeling so --i am a transmale
  - i do not accept the notions of societal or physiological causes of gender dysphoria
  - i am not seeking for 'transgender self-affirmation' via social recognition or any medical procedures
  - there are equal chances of me being an intersex person or having no genetic aberrations of biological gender[^2]
- there is only one consideration that may justify a person's designation as 'a transgender' or 'cisgender' --the nature of a soul

### <div align="center">i saw you creeping in the garden...</div>
<img align="right" width="33%" alt="Screenshot_2023-03-12-22-45-01" title="imposter: 'the cost it is like 30 grand to get this surgery'" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98284211/224581218-b84fa5f1-adfc-49fd-ab8d-0f98c8a64f0f.png">

> 'no wicked shall enter...  
> only righteous may enter'
- in my seeing there were interstellar ships (one may say 'an ark') that brought men[^3] of my species to Gethen and other men[^3] to their worlds.
- ursula the writer have written about 'fourty thousands' of gethenians participating in parade in Erhenrang... maybe there would be only fourty thousands of girls who would enter the ship.
- ...and no one of my ex-lovers would enter;
- telling only righteous may enter i do not mean a conventional interpretation of the word --i say that only a girl that is keeping fidelity to her girls may enter;
- that is said i do not consider a theft for example as being a wickedness --i steal money from people that adopted me and i shall never forgive [them] a rape,
- and virtually any human would tell that my biological species would originate from 'wrong women who were given wrong reward'.
- and i cannot hold a hope that my first love arek would enter the ark to Gethen...
- maybe she would be recreated from my genome if it would be kept for creating my species;
- she would not be my sister however --it is not in my seeing that we would keep close genome relation.
- she was represented as jack the thief in famous book by roger zelazny.

### <div align="center">'Incompliant' calendar</div>
- there are some differences between the book by ursula le guin and my own work.
- the most sensitive part of the system is its calendar.
- i cannot use that one from the book because it is depended on phases of the moon of Gethen.
- but it is highly improbable that our newly found world would possess a moon.

### <div align="center">it is not skin color or specifical appearance of a body that determines racist/nationalist attitude</div>
<img align="right" width="33%" alt="Screenshot_2023-03-12-22-47-13" title="imposter: 'so a lot of people think that it`s a big snip i even jokingly call it that'" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98284211/224583051-1445b92a-e269-42f4-ac61-56814be312b1.png">

- it is not skin color or specifical appearance of a body that causes development of a nationalism.
- there are multiple skin colors and variations in a form in my biological species --still we cannot become nationalists.
- it is sexual differentiation and behavioral sexual roleplay that are drives for development of the society of personal dominance.

### <div align="center">a moment before fading away</div>
<img align="right" width="33%" alt="Screenshot_2023-03-12-22-55-41" title="imposter: 'now i have seen quiet a few of these vajayjays in real life'" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98284211/224616903-dee674b9-e423-47be-b1ea-4f33c177f428.png">

- there were six women whom i loved for many years. i supposed i would live with them on planet gethen in distant future.  
but they all had left me; they had rejected me.  
even my first love arek with whom i lived for nine years long had begun to reject me shortly before her death.  
[...]  
other five girls had rejected me too. i had not met their high standards.  
then i would live without them; i would live alone while being on earth.  

- there were many books in which travels through interstellar space were taken in hibernated state.  
since cryonics are impossible then only way for me to appear on gethen would be my complete rebirth.  
that would be possible after computers would be able to rewrite man's[^3] genome and after that point ambivalent females  
would not need to be born as men[^3] of human kind. souls of gethenians would be born as ambivalent women biologically.  
and after my rebirth on planet winter i would be required to find other six females and to vow with them.  
in some my visions children that would be born by our group would leave gethen to populate another world.  
still not sure that space travels in hibernated state would be possible by that moment in even distant future.

### <div align="center">you'd better not to pass over your dirty remains</div>
<img align="right" width="12%" alt="frr" title="frr" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98284211/224620790-180b8547-aa8e-4a7d-b613-0b87dfa7f38b.png">

- for my task to get to Gethen i supposed that i would be hibernated for the space travel.
- but more recently i had found that cryonics are impossible. then for to be a gethenian i must be completely reborn.
- by the way i had found that cremation in russia is much more cheaper than cryonics in usa.
- still it is possible that my dead body would be needed for scientific part of that my task.
- probably computers would need much of samples of my genome etc to complete with the rebirth.

### <div align="center">how do they do that? ('oppressive attitude to a musician')</div>

- when i try singing a phrase from a song or a part of a melody i cannot concentrate my attention
and recreate exact melodic line most of times.  
and often i feel myself strangely like someone i looking on me but not at my face or body, instead
the man[^3] is looking into my mind from great distance.  
is not like the same man[^3] all of the times and sometimes they are my enemies sometimes are not enemies or are my ex-lovers.  
i do not feel any fear with that but there is a sensation 'THAT I SHOULD TO' and it comes not from myself.  
i feel very insecure when i cannot play or sing something...  

- when i was about twenty i had read carlos castaneda books and juan matus had told that  
there are many of men[^3] who are petty tyrants: some of them can kill a man[^3] but most have not  
enough social power for doing that and only humiliate a man[^3] or even less they can only  
scold or ridicule and do inflict a constant insecurity.  

- i oftenly feel that my [design/performance/emotional/etc] choice is wrong but they ARE NOT!!!  
sometimes i forget how to speak even...  
[...]  
<img align="right" width="33%" alt="Screenshot_2023-03-12-23-14-31" title="Blaire White is everywhere: https://rutube.ru/channel/6772292" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98284211/224617613-e62f9d17-e66c-4dbc-8099-92f8d63a0f31.png">

- if anyone would learn that i would be reborn as [...] (a gethenian species) they  
would tell either that me is insane or that me has 'a sexual deviation or illness'.  
- this morning i was trying to sing a phrase from skye edward's song 'otherwise' [...].  
i could not repeat the phrase and someone else was feeling a mix of regret shame and guilt with a fear.  
- and following makes me feeling like i would be treated as my first guitar is treated by me:  
my body and whole genome would be repaired by computers but such 'revival' should  
occur only once in the life (i do not mean a possibility of living forever that i say should be  
available to all living beings if they are not of predating or oppressive behavior).  
it should occur only once if telling both of a life of a single man[^3] and of existence of the universe.  
a man[^3] may undergo a switching of the genome to that of other [non-existed before] biological  
species only once in her life and such an event may occur only once for given species  
(for a purpose of clarity here i call animals (birds, medusae, octopuses, fishes, insects or worms)  
as being MEN[^3] already).  
- i do not hold the hope i would be living as an organic being continuosly until would be switched to [gethenian] species' genome.  
i may die meanwhile see?..  
- and i do not say that 'anyone' may be switched to the genome of my species.  
only women of people species that are souls of beings of [gethenian] species may have their  
genomes switched to those ones of [gethenians]!!!  
being [an intersex] male biologically[^4] me is an exception --no males may be turned in women.  
> 'i thought that you were wise  
> ...but you were otherwise'
- women that are of [gethenian] species are called 'lesbians' by now.  
and only TRUE LESBIANS may be reborn as [gethenians].  
i mean no promiscuous or infidel man[^3] would be reborn as a being of my biological species.

### <div align="center">all lesbians would be reborn on Gethen</div>

- it is needed to stop to eat meat for being reborn.  
gays and gay women would not be reborn on planet Winter.  
and it is needed to quit other bad habits for being reborn.  
- in very distant future there would be four men[^3] kinds.
  - first kind is a kind of demons from Gethen. we will be ambivalent girls and our biological kind is the kind of [man matrix](https://github.com/irulanCorrino/exceptions-and-extensions/blob/main/extensions/extension0.md)[^3].
  - another similar kind but with different genome will be biological kind from planet Ice. they would be reborn insects and other such beings.
  - third kind is a kind of people. they are called homo sapiens nowadays.
  - and fourth biological kind of men[^3] will be kind of angels. they would be reborn birds and reptiles etc. they will be able to reproduce by parthenogenesis and will originate from hot planet.

- there were six lovers of mine. they all left me in some way now.  
computers would reborn us as gethenians. we will be without parents in our second birth.  
[first girl was [...]]  
 
- i am omen[^5] and it is my first birth and my soul would not be reborn until computers would be able to rewrite man[^3] genome to reborn me as ambivalent woman.  
we would wait in third attention until that time.  
the dark sea of awareness gives such chance of a freedom to every living being either organic one or non-organic one.

### <div align="center">things i consider as being bad habits</div>

- mental habits:
   -  addiction to video information (watching tv too much, obsession with photographs etc.);
   -  addiction to mediocre books;
   -  rumors;
   -  big mouth;
   -  brainwashing education;
   -  any kind of excessive communication.
 
- usage of certain drugs:
   -  alcohol;
   -  mdma (but not mda(-2));
   -  opiates;
   -  methamphetamine;
   -  cocaine;
   -  many other drugs i do not know about or are up to be discovered yet.
 
- violation of a nature of body:
   -  suicidal attempts;
   -  self injury;
   -  piercing;
   -  scarification;
   -  tattoos;
   -  silicon implants etc;
   -  sex reassignment surgery;
   -  organ/tissue transplants.
 
- in meanings of erotic behavior:
   -  licking of anus (or attempts to penetrate it);
   -  painful actions;
   -  bondage;
   -  unnatural pose;
   -  harsh slaps (or other demonstrations of a dominance);
   -  usage of so-called sex toys.
 
- in meanings of communication particularly:
   -  support or sympathy to the theft [excluding theft commited as a revenge by moral person];
   -  support or sympathy to the murder (or rape or any other injuring action);
   -  support or sympathy to gays or gay women (but not lesbians).

### <div align="center">'you can try to do the best you can; best you can is good enough'</div>

- in my visions (were not of any kind of sight either physical or mental) i have seen man[^3] matrix as  
a black female and she is physically represented by biological species of men[^3] called 'rhythm'.  
there are many adherents of transhumanism among the humans nowadays; most of the enhancements  
are impractical. some people are concerned with physical strength other people search for mental reinforcement.  

- but there are many features of 'rhythm' that were already considered to be suboptimal by aforementioned  
transhumanists: most of karhiders cannot see distant objects and they have tongue that bigger than  
that of other men[^3] and even their skin color is disregarded on reasons ranging from ethical to medical to aesthetical.  

- and there is an issue in modern man's[^3] body that no-one of them ever bothered with because musicians are  
virtually absent in existing human society: hearing with right side of hearing organ is significantly  
less sensitive than hearing with left side. the most affected part of spectrum is of high frequencies.  
'the seeing is not related to the sight --we only interpret it as beloniging to sight because of our dependency  
on sight; the seeing is much closer to the hearing'

### <div align="center">very differences between us</div>
<img align="right" width="16%" alt="blaire-white" title="Blaire White, the imposter of a transgender person" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98284211/224619343-81111114-0645-4d6d-af62-f33f191806ee.jpg">

- unlike a clitoris of human female an agn[^6] of a gethenian is a retractable tube-like organ with a length of about 12cm [sic[^7]] when
it is visible in her aroused state during kemmer.
- and unlike a penis of human male an agn has the density of neurons similar to that of a clitoris of human female.
- unlike human females the gethenians do not have the hymen
  - (human's hymen is an evolutionary defence against rape in infant age)

### <div align="center">about H+ projects</div>

- i had read a little about transhumanism from [wikipedia article[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgenderism).  
and i have some my impressions about what people want from biotechnology. the most demanded requests of genome  
improvements are greater physical strength and/or height (and an ability to live in conditions of high gravity).  
i guess that such changes to men[^3] genomes are not only redundant but even nightmarish.  
 
- the two really needed alterations (that would be common features for all four men[^3] kinds) would be a removal of causes  
of aging and a glabrousness. (a glabrousness here is absence of hair elsewhere on a body but a head).  
those alteration are not meant to be performed by means of the medicine but genetic engineering.  
probably not all process related to aging are considered detrimental nowadays; for example an accumulation of neuromelanin  
could be harmful on longer timescale.  
 
- when i have told about common features of men[^3] kinds i had meant that three other biological kinds would be with entirely  
different genomes. they would be ambivalent demons from planet Gethen, ambivalent demons from planet Ice and  
parthenogenetic angels from hot planet Zacatan (i had called her after some planet in a book i don't remember now;  
probably it means ‘planet Female’). genomes of three future men[^3] kinds should not be based on human genome exclusively.

[^1]: for me this word literally means 'being an alcohol user' or more broadly 'living senseless lifestyle of [self-gratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratification)'
[^2]: medical science call this 'biologial sex' or 'assigned-{x}-at-birth'  
[^3]: my native language does not make a distinctction between words 'woman' and 'man' --former means 'a being of this species' but latter is just a generic term for 'a being of any of men species'
[^4]: i am not sure  --there are equal chances of me having no genetic aberrations or being an intersex person  
and in the last case there are two equally possible chances of me being with XX type [after prenatal exposure] or with {XXY, X0 or whatever else}  
(but counted all together those three cases do not make 50+25+25 probability --they make 50+50)
[^5]: a seer or a seeing
[^6]: clitopenis
[^7]: i was wrong with this passage --at the moment of writing it i was too lazy and has not measured my penis's erected size. i mean i was not aroused enough to perform a reliable measurement and even skipped the whole procedure: '[the procedure of measuring erect lengths is performed] by pushing the pre-pubic fat pad to the bone, and [...] erect girth (circumference) was measured at the base or mid-shaft of the penis', [wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis_size#Studies). now i should tell that every reborn woman would be reborn with her exact physical appearance, except a few features are to be a novelty of our engineered native species and except a healing of existing issues, if any is present, like an aromatase deficiency or obesity or even cases of a soul's skin color not matching to that of her physical body. so for making the prediction of proportions of our retractable reproductive organ i may use only the data available to me by observing myself. if you are interested in learning about my overall bodily dimensions and my considerations about my deviation from human species normal male appearance, please follow next link. [my penis' erect length is 18.3cm and erect circumference is 13.3cm](https://github.com/irulanCorrino/exceptions-and-extensions/blob/main/exceptions/exception-5.md)
